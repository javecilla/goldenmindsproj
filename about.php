                      Groups were formed. Each of them had flag with different colors that signifies their team; it was raised proudly during the opening parade. Afterwards, cheers were heard not just from the participants, but also from the hyped audience as each team performed in the cheerdance competition.

                      Over a thousand of people attended the Opening Celebration. It includes the school administration, faculty members, staffs, students, parents, and the municipal and barangay workers in Guiguinto, Bulacan. Along with them was the respected public servant, Mayor Ambrosio "Boy" C. Cruz Jr. who also delivered a brief congratulatory speech for the school.

                      Laced with excitement, senior high school students gathered at GMC Balagtas Branch after the opening ceremony to join the indoor sports. Every team had representative/s for Tabble Tennis, Dart, Domino, Scrabble, Word Factory, Chess, Uno Cards and many more. Each team exhibited different strategies as they all aimed to win.

                      Divided by different teams yet united with one goal: to enjoy- one of the many reasons why the school included these activities in their Anniversary Celebration. As the school principal, Dr.Leonora Malibiran, said "It is the time for them to temporarily forget their school works and just enjoy playing."
